##Video Notes##

###1.PLAN###
-atleast a little bit

1. Think about your intent of the product
  -What are you building? What market are you trying to target?
2. Think about your content
  -What info you want out there
  -Different ways to deliver that content
  -Keep it simple
  -Creat a sitemap (how information cohesively flows together into final product)
  -Sketch
  -Wireframes (balsamiq.com
    -to see how user goes through your application
3. Establish Hierarchy
  -from selecting items to paying for items
  -how you can play with hierarchy to make most important info be most easily consumable
  -communication
  -Hierarchy is also about storytelling; it's about our user's journey through the website and the user flow we create (Rachel Shillcock)
  -font size to body text
  -stylistic elements like lists, quotes, imagery (not so repetitive and boring)
  -Color / Contrast / Size / Alignment / Repetition/ White space
4. Color
  -Complementary colors for big contrast and boldness
  -Tint: add white
  -Shade: add black
  -Tone: add gray
  -Emotions and choosing color
5. Type
  -Serif fonts have the little feet (embellishments)
    -more classic/ easier to read in print
  -Sans Serif dont have feet and look more modern
  -Don't use more than 3 fonts on a single page
  -Don't switch fonts mid sentence
  -Use Sans serif fonts for online body text and serif fonts for headlines and print
  -Use monospace fonts for typewriter text and code blocks
  -Script and fantasy fonts for accents
6. Choosing Fonts
  -Font families
    -ex. Helvetica (Ultra light to Black)
    -font pairings of same families look nice
  -Google fonts
7. Modular Scale (Type scale)
  - Trust your eyes
8. Responsive Type
9. Imagery!
