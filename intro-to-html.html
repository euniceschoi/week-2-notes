What is special about HTML5?
-a lot of different tags
-footer and aside tag for instance
-html5doctor.com
-meta tags go in the head and give more representation of the head like title, base, link, src (more of a search engine thing)
-main tag shows that the content in the main tag is the main content (for those using a screen reader to parse content will find it useful)
